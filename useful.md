# Useful Stuff

## Statistics

To perform statistical phylogenetic analyses it helps to understand the basic principles of statistical analysis and probability, especially Bayesian statistics. Here is a brief tutorial that conveys the basic ideas:

## Using the Shell

Many bioinformatic and phylogenetic tools are run from the command line. Try using the command prompt and familiarize yourself with the following commands:

* cd
* pwd
* ls
* mkdir

## Using R for Statistics

R is super useful for performing analyses and visualizing results:

## Bayesian Phylogenetics

You should familiarize yourself a little with the basic ideas behind Bayesian phylogenetics. Here are three great papers that should introduce you to the topic if you are not familiar yet.

* [Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny and Its Impact on Evolutionary Biology](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5550/2310)
* [Potential Applications and Pitfalls of Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/51/5/673/1678428/Potential-Applications-and-Pitfalls-of-Bayesian)
* [Phylogeny estimation: traditional and Bayesian approaches](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v4/n4/abs/nrg1044.html)

## RevBayes

We're a bit biased about what phylogenetic software you should use.
Many different types of phylogenetic analyses can be performed directly in RevBayes and the tutorials explain the models and how to set them up.

## Other Software

Here are some other programs that can be useful:
