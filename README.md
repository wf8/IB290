# IB290: Topics in Phylogenetics
# UC Berkeley

* Grad Seminar 460
* Class Number 67082
* Fall, 2017
* Wednesdays 5:15 - 6:45 PM
* 1002 VLSB
* Class website: [https://wf8.github.io/ib290/](https://wf8.github.io/ib290/)

## Instructors

* Carl Rothfels -- crothfels@berkeley.edu
* John Huelsenbeck -- johnh@berkeley.edu
* Will Freyman -- freyman@berkeley.edu

## Format 

The instructors will lead a series of introductory sessions (lectures) for the first four or five meetings. Subsequent meetings will be student-led. Each student will be responsible for leading at least one session (potentially more, depending on enrollment and interest) on a topic of their choice, in consultation with the instructors. That student will be responsible for developing an annotated bibliography of the important papers on the topic, including both “classics” and the most recent works, for selecting two or so of the papers for the class to read, and for preparing a short (15min) presentation on the topic. The remainder of the session will be devoted to discussion.

## Course Texts 

There are no formal texts required for this seminar, but participants are encouraged to consult *Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology* (Baum & Smith 2012) and also *Inferring Phylogenies* (Felsenstein 2004).

## Schedule:

Our first meeting will be on Wednesday, August 30.

### August 30: Introductions

*Who are we, and want to do we want to get out of this seminar?*
* Outline of the course
* Outline of “phylogenetics” (introduction to trees—what is a phylogeny?—and tree thinking—what does this tree say?, [how to infer trees and what to do with them])
* Discussion of topics to select for future class sessions

### September 6: Introduction to probability theory

*Introduction to probability, estimation, and inference:*
* maximum likelihood
* Bayesian estimation
* MCMC

### September 13: Introduction to tree inference and Markov models

*Introduction to the application of Markov models to tree inference:*
* substition models
* pruning algorithm
* etc.

### September 20: Introduction to birth-death processes

*Introduction to the application of birth-death processes to estimate:*
* divergence times
* diversification rates
* character state dependent speciation and extinction


### September 27: Phylogenetics potpourri

*Phylogenetics potpourri:* 
* alignment
* homology
* NJ/MP/ML/BI recap
* bootstrapping
* gene trees versus species tree

### Future meetings: Student led discussions... TBD!
